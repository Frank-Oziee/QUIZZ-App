 * Installation
Yarn:

$ yarn add react-split
npm:

$ npm install --save react-split
Include with a module bundler like rollup or webpack:

// using ES6 modules
import Split from 'react-split'

// using CommonJS modules
var Split = require('react-split')
The UMD build is also available on unpkg:

<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-split/dist/react-split.js"></script>
You can find the library on window.ReactSplit.

Usage
The <Split /> component wraps multiple children components to create a resizeable split view. The component is a light wrapper around the Split.js library and accepts (mostly) the same options.

import Split from 'react-split'

<Split>
    <ComponentA />
    <ComponentB />
</Split>
Reference
<Split>
Creates a Split instance and a <div> wrapper around the children components. All additional props are passed through to the to the <div> component.

Example
import Split from 'react-split'

<Split
    sizes={[25, 75]}
    minSize={100}
    expandToMin={false}
    gutterSize={10}
    gutterAlign="center"
    snapOffset={30}
    dragInterval={1}
    direction="horizontal"

Migrating from Split.js
Refer to Split.js documentation for the options the component accepts as props. The differences are noted below:

A few props are exempt from updating. These props are functions, these props will not trigger a componentDidUpdate. Following React best practices, and do not create functions in the render method. Instead, create them once and pass them as props.

gutter
elementStyle
gutterStyle
onDrag
onDragStart
onDragEnd
API
.setSizes(sizes) becomes the prop sizes={sizes}
.getSizes() is unavailable, but sizes are passed to onDragStart and onDragEnd
.collapse(index) becomes the prop: collapsed={index}
.destroy() is triggered automatically on componentWillUnmount

To target the question property value and other properties and their values from the given data, you can use JavaScript to parse the data and access the desired properties. Here's an example of how you can do it:

javascript
Copy code
const data = {
 response_code: 0,
 results: [
   {
     category: "General Knowledge",
     correct_answer: "S",
     difficulty: "medium",
     incorrect_answers: ["O", "A", "C"],
     question: "In the Morse code, which letter is indicated by 3 dots?",
     type: "multiple"
   },
   {
     category: "General Knowledge",
     correct_answer: "Yale University",
     difficulty: "medium",
     incorrect_answers: ["Princeton University", "Harvard University", "Columbia University"],
     question: "Which of the following Ivy League universities has its official motto in Hebrew as well as in Latin?",
     type: "multiple"
   },
   // ... more objects
 ]
};

// Accessing the question property value and other properties and their values
data.results.forEach((result, index) => {
 console.log(`Question ${index + 1}: ${result.question}`);
 console.log(`Category: ${result.category}`);
 console.log(`Correct Answer: ${result.correct_answer}`);
 console.log(`Difficulty: ${result.difficulty}`);
 console.log(`Incorrect Answers: ${result.incorrect_answers}`);
 console.log(`Type: ${result.type}`);
 console.log("----------------------------------------");
});
This code will iterate over the results array and log the question, category, correct answer, difficulty, incorrect answers, and type for each object in the array.

Note: The provided data appears to be in the form of a JavaScript object, so you can directly use it in your JavaScript code. If it is a string representation of the object, you'll need to parse it using JSON.parse() before accessing the properties.

To target the question property value and other properties and their values from the given data using React, you can create a component and use JSX to render the desired information. Here's an example:

jsx
Copy code
import React from 'react';

const DataComponent = ({ data }) => {
 return (
   <div>
     {data.results.map((result, index) => (
       <div key={index}>
         <h3>Question {index + 1}</h3>
         <p>Question: {result.question}</p>
         <p>Category: {result.category}</p>
         <p>Correct Answer: {result.correct_answer}</p>
         <p>Difficulty: {result.difficulty}</p>
         <p>Incorrect Answers: {result.incorrect_answers.join(', ')}</p>
         <p>Type: {result.type}</p>
         <hr />
       </div>
     ))}
   </div>
 );
};

export default DataComponent;
In your parent component, you can use the DataComponent and pass the data as a prop:

jsx
Copy code
import React from 'react';
import DataComponent from './DataComponent';

const App = () => {
 const data = {
   response_code: 0,
   results: [
     // ... data objects
   ],
 };

 return (
   <div>
     <h2>Data</h2>
     <DataComponent data={data} />
   </div>
 );
};

export default App;
Make sure to replace // ... data objects with the actual data objects you have provided.

The DataComponent component will iterate over the results array and render the question, category, correct answer, difficulty, incorrect answers, and type for each object in the array.

To target and use the question property value and other properties and their values from the given data using useEffect in React, you can parse the data and store it in state variables. Here's an example implementation:

jsx
Copy code
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

const App = () => {
 const [data, setData] = useState(null);

 useEffect(() => {
   // Sample data string
   const dataString =
     '{"response_code": 0, "results": [{"category": "General Knowledge","correct_answer": "S","difficulty": "medium","incorrect_answers": ["O", "A", "C"],"question": "In the Morse code, which letter is indicated by 3 dots?","type": "multiple"},{"category": "General Knowledge","correct_answer": "Yale University","difficulty": "medium","incorrect_answers": ["Princeton University", "Harvard University", "Columbia University"],"question": "Which of the following Ivy League universities has its official motto in Hebrew as well as in Latin?","type": "multiple"},{"category": "General Knowledge","correct_answer": "True","difficulty": "medium","incorrect_answers": ["False"],"question": "The bikini is named after the &quot;Bikini Atoll&quot;, an island where the United States conducted tests on atomic bombs.","type": "boolean"}]}';

   const parsedData = JSON.parse(dataString);
   setData(parsedData);
 }, []);

 return (
   <div>
     <h2>Data</h2>
     {data && (
       <div>
         {data.results.map((result, index) => (
           <div key={index}>
             <h3>Question {index + 1}</h3>
             <p>Question: {result.question}</p>
             <p>Category: {result.category}</p>
             <p>Correct Answer: {result.correct_answer}</p>
             <p>Difficulty: {result.difficulty}</p>
             <p>Incorrect Answers: {result.incorrect_answers.join(', ')}</p>
             <p>Type: {result.type}</p>
             <hr />
           </div>
         ))}
       </div>
     )}
   </div>
 );
};

export default App;
In this example, the data state variable is initially set to null. Inside the useEffect hook, the provided data string is parsed using JSON.parse, and the parsed data is stored in the data state variable using the setData function.

In the JSX code, the data is checked for existence (data &&) before rendering the data. If the data is available, it will map over the results array and render the question, category, correct answer, difficulty, incorrect answers, and type for each object in the array.

Note that you should replace the dataString in the example with your actual data string.

To target and use the question property value and other properties and their values from the given API data using useEffect in React, you can make an API request to fetch the data and then store it in state variables. Here's an example implementation:

jsx
Copy code
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

const App = () => {
 const [data, setData] = useState(null);

 useEffect(() => {
   const fetchData = async () => {
     try {
       const response = await fetch('<API_ENDPOINT>');
       const responseData = await response.json();
       setData(responseData);
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
     }
   };

   fetchData();
 }, []);

 return (
   <div>
     <h2>Data</h2>
     {data && (
       <div>
         {data.results.map((result, index) => (
           <div key={index}>
             <h3>Question {index + 1}</h3>
             <p>Question: {result.question}</p>
             <p>Category: {result.category}</p>
             <p>Correct Answer: {result.correct_answer}</p>
             <p>Difficulty: {result.difficulty}</p>
             <p>Incorrect Answers: {result.incorrect_answers.join(', ')}</p>
             <p>Type: {result.type}</p>
             <hr />
           </div>
         ))}
       </div>
     )}
   </div>
 );
};

export default App;
In this example, the data state variable is initially set to null. Inside the useEffect hook, an asynchronous function fetchData is defined, which makes an API request using the fetch function to the appropriate API endpoint. Replace '<API_ENDPOINT>' with the actual endpoint URL.

Once the API response is received, it is converted to JSON using response.json(), and the parsed data is stored in the data state variable using the setData function.

In the JSX code, the data is checked for existence (data &&) before rendering the data. If the data is available, it will map over the results array and render the question, category, correct answer, difficulty, incorrect answers, and type for each object in the array.

Make sure to replace '<API_ENDPOINT>' with the actual API endpoint URL you are using to fetch the data.
